            About Grove Guardian
        </h2>
        <p>Grove Guardian is your community tree care companion, designed to help coordinate and track the watering of young trees in our neighborhood. The app makes it easy to identify which trees need water and maintain a healthy urban forest.</p>

        <div class="why-tree-care">
            <h3>Why Tree Care Matters</h3>
            <p>Young trees need regular watering for the first two years after planting. Your participation helps ensure their survival and contributes to a greener, healthier community.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How to Water Trees</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Check the homepage for the current watering recommendation from Casey Trees.</li>
            <li>Look for trees marked as thirsty ðŸ˜« in either your Grove or the Thirsty Trees section.</li>
            <li>Use the interactive map to locate the tree.</li>
            <li>Find the nearest water source - look for the blue water droplet icons ðŸ’§ on the map which indicate hose locations.</li>
            <li>Fill the tree's watering bag completely - this ensures proper deep watering of the roots.</li>
            <li>After watering, slide the watering confirmation slider to record your contribution.</li>
            <li>Please remember to neatly wrap up the hose when you're finished to keep our community tidy and prevent tripping hazards.</li>
        </ol>
